# FireFox OS Info Grapher

A project from
[FireFoxOS App Day, Berlin, 2013](http://firefoxosappday-berlin.eventbrite.com/)

Totally in its infancy, the goal of this project is to show graphs of
device information - Battery info, network info, GPS, etc.  Whatever's
available in HTML5/JS APIs, could in theory be graphed and tracked.
